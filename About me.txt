My name is a Anuoluwapo, I'm a trained teacher, passionate about raising a generation of students who are outstanding academically and also spiritually enlightened. Young adults who are not tossed by every wind of doctrine. In achieving this, I studied Economics Education in School so as to reach out to students in the secondary schools. For me the classroom is not just a platform to transfer academic knowlegde, but also a ministry through which an end time army can be raised for Jesus. In class I ensure that students are taught discipline, honesty, love for God and their fellow human.
